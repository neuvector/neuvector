# NeuVector

NeuVector Full Lifecycle Container Security Platform delivers the only cloud-native security with uncompromising end-to-end protection from DevOps vulnerability protection to automated run-time security, and featuring a true Layer 7 container firewall.

A viewable version of docs can be seen at https://open-docs.neuvector.com.

The images are on the NeuVector Docker Hub registry. Use the appropriate version tag for the manager, controller, enforcer, and leave the version as 'latest' for scanner and updater. For example:
+ neuvector/manager:5.0.0
+ neuvector/controller:5.0.0
+ neuvector/enforcer:5.0.0
+ neuvector/scanner:latest
+ neuvector/updater:latest

Note: Deploying from the Rancher Manager 2.6.5+ NeuVector chart pulls from the rancher-mirrored repo and deploys into the cattle-neuvector-system namespace.
