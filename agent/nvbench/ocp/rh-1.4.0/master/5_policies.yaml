          You can remove users and groups from an SCC using the oc edit scc $NAME command.
          Additionally, you can create your own SCCs that contain the container functionality you need for a particular use case and assign that SCC to users and groups if the default SCCs are not appropriate for your use case.

          For any non-privileged pods or containers that do not have seccomp profiles, consider using the RuntimeDefault or creating a custom seccomp profile specifically for the workload.
          Please refer to the OpenShift documentation for working with custom seccomp profiles.

          manual "    * Review each pod and determine if there is an existing security context constraint that it should be using."
        remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts
          to your pods. For a suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to
          the CIS Security Benchmark for Docker Containers.

        remediation: Ensure that namespaces are created to allow for appropriate segregation
          of Kubernetes resources and that all new resources are created in a specific
          namespace.
