        remediation: |
          Seccomp is an alpha feature currently. By default, all alpha features are disabled. So, you would need to enable alpha features in the apiserver by passing --feature-gates=AllAlpha=true argument.
          Edit the /etc/kubernetes/apiserver file on the master node and set the KUBE_API_ARGS parameter to --feature-gates=AllAlpha=true
          KUBE_API_ARGS=--feature-gates=AllAlpha=true
          Based on your system, restart the kube-apiserver service. For example: systemctl restart kube-apiserver.service
          Use annotations to enable the docker/default seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An example is as below:
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Pod
            metadata:
            name: trustworthy-pod annotations:
