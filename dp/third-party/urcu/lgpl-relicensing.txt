McKenney and reviewed by Steven L. Bennett:

I (Mathieu Desnoyers) re-implemented ACCESS_ONCE(), likely(), unlikely() and
barrier() from scratch without reference to the original code.

Bert Wesarg <bert.wesarg@googlemail.com> approved LGPL relicensing of his
patch in an email dated May 13, 2009 :

   http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/5/13/16

xchg() primitives has been rewritten from a MIT-licensed cmpxchg for Intel
and powerpc. They are MIT-licensed and therefore usable in LGPL code.
This cmpxchg code was obtained from the atomic_ops project:

	http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/atomic_ops/

I (Mathieu Desnoyers) wrote the remainder of the code.

The license for the library files in this project was therefore changed to
LGPLv2.1 on May 13, 2009, as detailed in LICENSE.
